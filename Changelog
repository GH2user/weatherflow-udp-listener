Version 3.0
 - the (hopefully) unused 'weewx' option has been removed
 - now supports multiple sensors of the same type (two Sky, for example)
   for publishing to MQTT


Version 2.0
 - app is threaded in order to no miss listenining for UDP messages
   while writing to stdout or MQTT.  Previously there was a small
   possibility that messages could have been missed. Now it is 'very' small.

Version 1.0.9
 - original tagged release
